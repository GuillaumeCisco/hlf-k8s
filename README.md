# Substra network

This project demonstrates how you can set multiples organizations for dealing with the hyperledger project.
It is composed of at most 3 organizations : orderer, owkin and chu-nantes (optional).

The orderer organization contains an orderer instance named orderer1.
The owkin and chu-nantes organizations have each one 2 peers named peer1 and peer2.

Each organization has a root ca instance for dealing with the users.

## Launch

### Bootstrap

Run the `bootstrap.sh` script.  
:warning: If you are on linux and want to play with the substrabac projects, please read its documentation first. 

It will pull from the hyperledger registry the right docker images and then will build our own docker images from it.

### Test

Create at the root of your system a `substra` folder with your user rights:
```bash
$> sudo mkdir /substra
$> sudo chown guillaume:guillaume /substra
```
Replace `guillaume:guillaume` by your `user:group`.

```
$> python3 start.py --config conf1org.py --no-backup
```

:warning:
Launching `start.py` without the config option, will make a call of `python3 conf2orgs.py` internally.

- For launching a network from scratch,  without ising backup files, use `--no-backup` option (recommended in development mode).  
- For loading fixtures, test and revoke containers, pass the `--fixtures` or `-f` option.  
- If you do not want to call the `revoke` container, please comment it in the `start.py` file.

Roughly speaking, it will generate a docker-compose file (docker-compose-dynamic.yaml), build the network and run init config.

The `run` docker container will create channel, make peers joins channel, install chaincode and instantiate chaincode.  
The `fixtures` docker instance container will create some challenges, algo, dataset, train data, test data, traintuples on orgs.  
The `revoke` docker instance allow you to revoke an user.  

You now will be able to play with the network ! :tada:

:warning: Debugging: Make sure you have set a file named `substra-network.pth` in your virtualenv `lib/python3.6/site-packages` folder containing the absolute path to `substra-network/python-scripts` for being able to run fixtures scripts manually.


### Network

The docker-compose use the `net_substra` private network for running its docker, if you want to be able to enroll, invoke or query the ledger from the outside, you will have to modify your `/etc/hosts` file on your machine for mapping your localhost:

`/etc/hosts` file:
```shell
127.0.0.1       rca-owkin            # one or two org(s) setup
127.0.0.1       rca-chu-nantes       # two orgs setup
127.0.0.1       rca-orderer
127.0.0.1       peer1-owkin          # one or two org(s) setup
127.0.0.1       peer2-owkin          # one or two org(s) setup
127.0.0.1       peer1-chu-nantes     # two orgs setup
127.0.0.1       peer2-chu-nantes     # two orgs setup
127.0.0.1       orderer1-orderer
127.0.0.1       owkin.substrabac     # one or two org(s) setup
127.0.0.1       chunantes.substrabac # two orgs setup
```

Do not hesitate to reboot your machine for updating your new modified hosts values.

### substrabac

A backend is available named substrabac which can interact with this ledger.

Follow the instructions in the substrabac project for being able to query/invoke the ledger with the setup created by the run container.
